# Case_Study_New_System_Implementation
The following case study uses data from [HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov) using the [COVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by State Timeseries](https://healthdata.gov/Hospital/COVID-19-Reported-Patient-Impact-and-Hospital-Capa/g62h-syeh) dataset. 

Description about the dataset
"The following dataset provides state-aggregated data for hospital utilization in a timeseries format dating back to January 1, 2020. These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across three main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities and (3) National Healthcare Safety Network (before July 15)."

[HealthData.gov](https://healthdata.gov) regularly update the dataset with various information, such as critical staffing shortages, inpatient bed used, admissions for both adult & pediatric and much more. 

This case study will focus on the benefits of implementing a telemedicine system and how the hospital can better serve its patients and reduce the spread of COVID-19. 

I used SQL and MySQL to query data. To complete the analysis, I used Python in Rstudio. Then finally the case study was created in RMarkdown and then Knit into a sharable pdf with links to various resources.
